# RECIPIVERSE

This app is a social platform where people can share videos of their favourite food recipes and how it can be prepared.

I developed this app as part of my master's in Computer Science Mobile App Development module at Teesside University.

The app was developed in Android Studio Koala Feature Drop | 2024.1.2 with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin.


## Features of the App

- Splash Screen
- Onboarding Screen
- Signup/Login with Email and Password (Firebase Authentication)
- Signup/Login with Google Account
- Bottom Navigation in all authenticated screens
- Search Bar on the Home Screen
- Permission management with Accompanist Library
- ViewModels for all state management
- Camera for photo and video recording features
- Location, Places and Google Map integration
- Firebase Database for storing documents(user and post data)
- Firebase Storage for storing media files(videos and images)
- Firebase Authentication to handle user authentication
- Type safe navigation to ensure correct parameters are passed to different screens

NB: 

You will need to create secrets.properties and local.defaults.properties file in the project root directory and then supply your maps api key.

put this in secret.properties file, MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_MAPS_API_KEY

copy and paste this statement, MAPS_API_KEY=DEFAULT_API_KEY, into the local.defaults.properties

You are good to go.

## Agile Scrum Methodology | Trello | Figma | GitHub 

The whole project was executed using the Scrum Software Development Methodology.
Below is the link to the Project management tool, (Trello), I used during the development. The board shows what was done during each sprint.

I also did some mock designs for the app using Figma, below is the link to the mockup design.

GitHub was used as the version control solution and below is the link to the repository

I am proud of what I have been able to accomplish in the Mobile App Development Module.


This is the main branch with fully functional versions of the app.
